# Welcome to Scrambled Words: AI game repository



<br/>
<details>
  <summary><strong>👨‍💻 What am I developing?</strong></summary><br />

  I am going to create a project that has the objective to be a game of scrambled words where the player will interact with CHAT-GPT bot to help or confuse the player in this game. The goal is to be an educative game where a person can learn new words and it's meaning in a funny way.

  This is a game that uses CHAT-GPT API to create words and answers to the player. The player will interact with the bot that will either help or confuse the player. This is still a _WORK IN PROGRESS_! #let's go 🚀
